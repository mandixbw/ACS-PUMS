# ACS-PUMS
Here one can find sample code to access American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Samlpe (PUMS) and run simple analyses at the national and state level. The scripts are meant to be run in Stata or R, but the logic is transferable to other programs such as SAS, SPSS, and so on.
I will be populating this folder over time with new examples and requested code, so please check back in the future.
